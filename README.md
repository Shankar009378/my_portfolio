# Welcome to MyPortfolio!

Hello👋! I am **Shankar Kumar Nanda**. This project is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills and projects as a **Full-Stack Web Developer**. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and includes various technologies and features.


# Technologies Used

- **Next.Js** - A React framework for building server-side rendered   and statically generated web applications.
- **@emotion/react** and **@emotion/styled** - For styling components with CSS-in-JS.
- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for building modern designs.
- **Material-UI** - A popular React UI framework for building responsive and accessible user interfaces.
- **MongoDB** - For database storage and interaction.
- **Framer Motion** - A React animation library for creating smooth and interactive UI animations.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organised following the conventions of a Full Stack Application. Key directories include:-

-   `public`: Contains static assets like images and fonts.
-   `app`: Contains the pages of the application.
-   `assets`: Contains project-related assets.
-   `components`: Reusable React components.
-   `database`: Contains database-related files and configurations.
-   `models`: Contains data models used in the application.
-   `services`: Contains service-related files and configurations.

## Getting Started

 To run the development server, use the following commands: 
 `` `bash 
 npm run dev 
 or 
 yarn dev 
 or 
 pnpm dev
 
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.
